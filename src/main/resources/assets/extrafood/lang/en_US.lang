cookbook.cheesewheel=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|By pressurizing milk repetitively, one's ability to create new foods such as cheese is formed. Cheese wheels are your first steps to healthy food, and an introduction into the food world. This is made in the Cheese Press.><HungerStats|-1|-1|1|4|5.6|Cheese Wheel>
cookbook.cheeseslice=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|Cheese slices are used in many recipes throughout Extra Food. They are mainly used in pizza, and they are also used in sandwiches (notably, the grilled cheese ones.) Their other use is to be a snack, healthier than an entire cheese wheel.><Crafting|-1|-1|1|cheeseslice><HungerStats|-1|-1|2|1|3.0|Cheese Slice>
cookbook.knife=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|The cutting knife, a staple of any good kitchen, is used for many cutting tasks. These range from cutting meats, fruits and other foods. When killing entities, such as the pig, rare drops may occur, such as bacon or in the case of young cows, veal.><Crafting|-1|-1|1|knife>
cookbook.bacon=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|You've decided that pigs are a great source of alternative meat. Despite your love for AntVenom (Anti-pig killing) and OhaiIchun, you see the usefulness of pigs: BACON. Using the knife you made earlier, you can kill pigs and get bacon as a drop. This can be eaten in it's raw form (although not recommended) and can also be cooked into the><TextBlock|-1|-1|1|perfect delectable slice of meat.><HungerStats|-1|-1|2|0.5|0.6|Bacon><HungerStats|-1|-1|3|1|5.2|Cooked Bacon>
cookbook.cheesepress=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|The cheese press is the first simple machine from Extra Foods. Requiring no power, it will convert milk buckets into cheese wheels. This will be your first steps into the "new age", where you can eat more foods of different types and not be stuck with Pork, Steak and carrots!><Crafting|-1|-1|1|cheesepress><TextBlock|-1|-1|2|To use this block, you must put 3 milk buckets into the top slots (1). This can also be done with hoppers and any form of automation from the top/all sides of the block. Cheese Wheels will appear in the bottom slot (2), and can be pulled out with hoppers or automation from the bottom of the block. Empty buckets can also be pulled out from the><TextBlock|-1|-1|3|bottom of the block.><Image|-1|-1|3|extrafood:textures/gui/cookbookimages/CheesePressGUIHelper.png|105|79|0|0>
cookbook.spread=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|You have decided to use the fruits and nuts you've found in order to make spreads. These "spreads" taste very good in a sandwich, but you've questioned the safety of eating them alone. They seem to give you weird effects, and your not sure if that is good or bad!><HungerStats|-1|-1|2|2.5|5.0|Jelly><Crafting|-1|-1|3|jelly><HungerStats|-1|-1|4|4.0|4.5|Chocolate Spread><Crafting|-1|-1|5|chocolateSpread><HungerStats|-1|-1|6|1.5|4.5|Peanut Butter><Crafting|-1|-1|7|peanutButter>
cookbook.grater=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|To cut all your food finer than your knife does, you've invented a grater. This has been very useful in refining natural foods to a more spreadable kind. You feel like one day, this will become even more useful><Crafting|-1|-1|1|grater>
cookbook.worldGen=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|As you start to wander a new world, you see different types of blocks that you've never seen before.><Image|-1|-1|0|extrafood:textures/gui/cookbookimages/WorldGen.png|75|40|0|0><Image|28|108|0|extrafood:textures/gui/cookbookimages/WorldGen.png|75|40|75|0><TextBlock|-1|-1|1|When right clicking on these blocks, they seem to bear food, which you have named strawberries and peanuts. These seem to have a low health value, but combinding them other foods may fix that.><TextBlock|-1|-1|2|You have also seen some nice yellow fruits hanging off trees. When you break the block, you've notice you can get anywhere from 4 - 6 edible bananas! The leaves also drop saplings to regrow the trees.><Image|-1|-1|2|extrafood:textures/gui/cookbookimages/WorldGen.png|75|40|150|0><HungerStats|-1|-1|3|2|0.8|Banana><TextBlock|-1|-1|4|Another type of tree you may encounter is the "olive tree". This tree's leaves seem to produce a nice tasting food, it just takes a long time for it to grow. The leaves drop saplings that can be planted elsewhere.><HungerStats|-1|-1|5|2|3.0|Olives>
cookbook.plants=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|In order to fully expand your tastebuds, you started to hit grass. Though unexciting, while you hit it, different seeds dropped. You've found two extra types: Tomato and raw lettuce seeds. To make lettuce seeds usable, you must coat them in clay.><Crafting|-1|-1|1|uselettuceSeeds><TextBlock|-1|-1|2|You can also extract seeds from tomato's in order to get more tomato seeds.><Crafting|-1|-1|3|tomatoSeeds>
cookbook.boneBlock=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|In an effort to be more compact, you've smashed together the broken bits of bone and created a block. This block is so pure white, that it contains a clear texture, no extra colors. PURE WHITE!! Now what can you do with that?><Crafting|-1|-1|1|whiteout>

When a custom block is needed, there will be a page of instructions for that block. Each of the cookbook's tabs are different methods to prepare food.>
cookbook.butter=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|Once you realized that heating milk would produce a thicker substance, you started to test things.

cookbook.autocutter=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|Realizing the cutting potential of the knife caused you to have a spontaneous good idea! You seem to have automated the knife, and compressed the entire contraption into the size of a block. It seems a little strange to have a knife cut by itself, but eveything will be good if you keep your hands away from it!><Crafting|-1|-1|1|autoCutter><TextBlock|-1|-1|2|In order to use the Autocutter, you must place a knife, with any durability, into the slot furthest to the right. Any item you want to cut, goes into the top slot and once cut, it will output into the bottom slot.

cookbook.BananaJuice=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|Why do you do this to yourself? Crushing bananas sounded like a good idea. Then you drank it. It tasted funny. REALLY funny. And yet you consumed it.

cookbook.SeaWater=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|As you travel from island to island and your food runs dry, you feel you could eat anything.

cookbook.purifiedWater=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|The salty water started to bother you. But your creativity helped to find a nice solution! If you put the Sea Water into a furnace, you can get Purified water, wich removes that horrible taste!><HungerStats|-1|-1|1|2|0.5>

cookbook.sandwiches=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|By mixing different foods together, you have created a new array of things to eat. In this newest creation of yours, you've slapped some different items between bread, and created a "Sandwich". These will light up your taste buds and are very easy to craft.
